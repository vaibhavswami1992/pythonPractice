The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless:
The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.

Answer:

def is_leap(year):
    leap = False
    
    # Write your logic here
    if year%4==0 and year%100!=0: 
       leap=True
    elif year%400==0 and year %100==0:
        leap=True
    else:
        leap=False    
    return leap

year = int(input())
print(is_leap(year))
