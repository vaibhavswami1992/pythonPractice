The year can be evenly divided by 4, is a leap year, unless:
The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless:
The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.

Answer:

def is_leap(year):
    leap = False
    
    # Write your logic here
    if year%4==0 and year%100!=0: 
       leap=True
    elif year%400==0 and year %100==0:
        leap=True
    else:
        leap=False    
    return leap

year = int(input())
print(is_leap(year))


# Python program to check if year is a leap year or not

year = 2000

# To get year (integer input) from the user
# year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

# divided by 100 means century year (ending with 00)
# century year divided by 400 is leap year
if (year % 400 == 0) and (year % 100 == 0):
    print("{0} is a leap year".format(year))

# not divided by 100 means not a century year
# year divided by 4 is a leap year
elif (year % 4 ==0) and (year % 100 != 0):
    print("{0} is a leap year".format(year))

# if not divided by both 400 (century year) and 4 (not century year)
# year is not leap year
else:
    print("{0} is not a leap year".format(year))
